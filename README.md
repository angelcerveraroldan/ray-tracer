# Ray Tracer

A rust ray tracer (being made using the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge")

# Later

- [ ] Load yaml file describing where each objec is and what its materia is, and render image from it
- [ ] GPU bindings
- [ ] Make ray tracer usable through a website with WASM 

# TODO's

## Math Lib

Move the math side of the project to its own crate. Make this a linear algebra crate specifically for up
to 4d (hyper-optimized small matrix operations)

Similarly, optimizations could be made for Vectors

This is not so much *necessary* but it would be cool
